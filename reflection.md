Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

What are your initial impressions of how `Unit Testing` affects your programming?
- I thought it was really useful. From the concept to the implementation makes a lot of sense why it's used.

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
To answer this all in one, here is the advice with do's and dont's:
* Do's
    - Google search as much as you feel a need to. You might learn new methods that are useful or stumble across the exact same question someone has asked online 6 years ago. The Internet is truly magical.
    - Start the assignment ASAP
    - Ask for help
    
* Dont's
    - Sit there for hours waiting for your Eureka moment â€“ It won't happen.
    - Procrastinate and wait until the day before to start. If anything, starting earlier gives you a lighter workload. Just read through the README and do one thing!
    - Ignore sleep and rest.
